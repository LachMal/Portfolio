# Portfolio

My name is Margaret.

Last year, I decided to change my professional life and chose software testing and QA Engineering, because both of these professional spheres have been close to me for many years.

Since September 2023, I have been intensively learning the software testing and the taking care of its quality in two professional schools. 

In my portfolio, I have included documents presenting my activities in these areas along with an indication of the tools I use.

I invite you to read,

Best regards.
