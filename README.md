# Portfolio

My name is Margaret.

I am motivated to carry out interesting projects and to expand my knowledge and skills as a manual tester with many years of experience in working with people. 
I'm looking for a job because I want to do what will allow me to use my knowledge, skills and experience and give me the opportunity to develop further. I would like to pursue my career as a manual tester in the direction of automation. 
Since graduating, I've been constantly educating myself, mainly in the field of IT skills.  
I have carried out projects in cooperation with WideLane and projects during postgraduate studies and in schools educating me to become a Manual Tester (CodersLab) and a QA Engineer (GoIt).


Best regards.
